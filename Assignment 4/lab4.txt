Laboratory: Debugging a C program
=================================

I downloaded and installed the buggy version of coreutils:

    mkdir -p ~/lab4/prefix
    curl -sS http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz | tar xzvC ~/lab4
    cd ~/lab4/coreutils-with-bug
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/lab4/prefix
    make

The build failed with the following error message:

    In file included from utimecmp.c:41:0:
    utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
     int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
         ^~~~~~~~
    In file included from utimecmp.h:25:0,
                     from utimecmp.c:25:
    /usr/include/sys/stat.h:373:12: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
     extern int futimens (int __fd, const struct timespec __times[2]) __THROW;
                ^~~~~~~~

I then applied the renaming patch and tried the build again:

    curl -sS http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff | sed '/^---/ { s/~/ /g }' | patch -p0
    make install

The build succeeded. I then reproduced the issue:

    tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
    cd "$tmp"
    touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
    touch now && sleep 1 && touch now1
    TZ=UTC0 ~/lab4/prefix/bin/ls -lt --full-time *

I read through some relevant parts of the source code and determined that the
cause was an integer overflow in the comparison function timespec_cmp for the
tv_sec field inside the struct timespec. I changed the comparison function to
avoid the overflow and then tested it again. The program works now.

I also tried the test case in my home directory. It claims that the file
wwwi-armistice is modified on December 17, 2054. This is likely due to a
filesystem limitation and being unable to store a negative timestamp:

    touch -d '1970-01-01 00:00 GMT' epoch
    touch -d '1969-12-31 23:59:59 GMT' before-epoch

The first correctly stores zero as the timestamp, but the second has a
timestamp of Feb 7, 2106, 6:28:15 UTC. Notably, this is exactly 2^32-1 seconds
since the epoch, or 4,294,967,295. This shows that the timestamp is stored as
an unsigned 32-bit integer.
