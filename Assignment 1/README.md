Commentary for Assignment 1
===========================

Assignment 1, entitled "Getting to know your system" is trivial for a seasoned
Linux user, but too hard for the beginner. For the beginner, it seems to
introduce a tremendous number of concepts, principles, tools, and utilities.

For the homework, certain parts are way too tedious. Following commands to do
the editing tasks turns what should be a natural product of text editing into
something mechanical. It may approximate the mechanics of using Emacs well, but
does so in a forced and unnatural way.

Exercise 1.5 is a nice quine. I wished it wasn't given directly, but rather as a
sequence of steps to derive this quine.

The last bit about random numbers is amusing and fun, but hardly enlightening
for the beginning CS student this course is intended for.
