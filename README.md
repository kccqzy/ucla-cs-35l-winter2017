UCLA CS 35L Winter 2017 Problem Solutions
=========================================

This repository contains my solutions to problems in UCLA CS 35L (Winter 2017).
This is a class on software construction, and focuses on learning open source
tools and utilities, including the GNU userland, Emacs, and various other
utilities.

Please attempt questions on your own before looking at my solutions.
Specifically, because each year each Teaching Assistant may have different
grading criteria, what I write here may or may not be suitable for your
purposes.
